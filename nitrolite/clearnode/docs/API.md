## Authentication

### Authentication Request

Initiates authentication with the server and register a session key.

NOTE: currently it is required to register a session key with an authentication request.

NOTE: when authenticating with an already registered session key, you must provide all the fields of the request.
However, they do not need to be the same as during session key registration as they would just be ignored.
This logic is to be improved in the future.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "req": [
    1,
    "auth_request",
    {
      "address": "0x1234567890abcdef...",
      "session_key": "0x9876543210fedcba...", // If specified, enables delegation to this key
      "application": "Example App", // Application name for analytics (defaults to "clearnode" if not provided)
      "allowances": [
        // Asset allowances for the session
        {
          "asset": "usdc",
          "amount": "100.0"
        }
      ],
      "scope": "app.create", // Permission scope (e.g., "app.create", "ledger.readonly")
      "expires_at": 1762417328, // Session expiration timestamp
      "application": "0xApp1234567890abcdef..." // Application public address
    },
    1619123456789
  ],
  "sig": ["0x5432abcdef..."] // Client's signature of the entire 'req' object
}
```

### Authentication Challenge

Server response with a challenge token for the client to sign.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "res": [
    1,
    "auth_challenge",
    {
      "challenge_message": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
    },
    1619123456789
  ],
  "sig": ["0x9876fedcba..."] // Server's signature of the entire 'res' object
}
```

### Authentication Verification

Completes authentication with a challenge response.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "req": [
    2,
    "auth_verify",
    {
      "challenge": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
    },
    1619123456789
  ],
  "sig": ["0x2345bcdef..."] // Client's EIP-712 signatures of the challenge data object
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "res": [
    2,
    "auth_verify",
    {
      "address": "0x1234567890abcdef...",
      "success": true,
      "jwt_token": "eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..." // JWT token for subsequent requests
    },
    1619123456789
  ],
  "sig": ["0xabcd1234..."] // Server's signature of the entire 'res' object
}
```

#### JWT Authentication

After successful authentication, the server provides a JWT token that can be used for subsequent authenticated requests. The JWT contains:

- Policy information with wallet address, participant, scope, and expiration
- Permission scopes (e.g., "app.create", "ledger.readonly")
- Asset allowances (if specified during auth_request)
- Standard JWT claims (issued at, expiration, etc.)

The JWT token has a default validity period of 24 hours and must be refreshed by making a new authentication request before expiration.

#### Session Key Spending Caps

When authenticating with a session key, you can specify spending allowances to limit the amount of each asset that can be spent using that session key:

- **With allowances**: If you provide an `allowances` array with specific assets and amounts, the session key will be limited to spending those amounts. Once a session key reaches its spending cap for an asset, all further operations requiring that asset will be rejected with an error: `"operation denied: insufficient session key allowance: X required, Y available"`

- **Empty allowances**: If you provide an empty `allowances` array (`[]`), the session key will have zero spending allowed for all assets. Any operation attempting to spend funds will be rejected.

- **Validation**: All assets specified in allowances must be supported by the system. Unsupported assets will cause authentication to fail with an error: `"unsupported token: asset 'X' is not supported"`

The server tracks spending per session key by recording which session key was used for each ledger debit operation. You can view current spending usage via the `get_session_keys` endpoint.

## Ledger Management

### Get Channels

Retrieves all channels for a participant (both open, closed, and joining), ordered by creation date (newest first). This method returns channels across all supported chains. If no participant is specified, it returns all channels.
Supports pagination and sorting by providing optional request parameters and metadata fields in response.

> Sorted descending by `created_at` by default.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "req": [1, "get_channels", {}, 1619123456789],
  "sig": []
}
```

**Request with pagination and sorting:**

```json
{
  "req": [
    1,
    "get_channels",
    {
      "participant": "0x1234567890abcdef...", // Optional: filter by participant
      "status": "open", // Optional filter
      "offset": 42, // Optional: pagination offset
      "limit": 10, // Optional: number of channels to return
      "sort": "desc" // Optional: sort asc or desc by created_at
    },
    1619123456789
  ],
  "sig": []
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "res": [
    1,
    "get_channels",
    {
      "channels": [
        {
          "channel_id": "0xfedcba9876543210...",

          "status": "closed",
          "token": "0xeeee567890abcdef...",
          "amount": "50000",
          "chain_id": 42220,
          "adjudicator": "0xAdjudicatorContractAddress...",
          "challenge": 86400,
          "nonce": 1,
          "version": 3,
          "created_at": "2023-04-15T10:00:00Z",
          "updated_at": "2023-04-20T14:30:00Z"
        }
      ],
      "metadata": {
        "page": 5,
        "per_page": 10,
        "total_count": 56,
        "page_count": 6
      }
    },
    1619123456789
  ],
  "sig": ["0xabcd1234..."]
}
```

The signature in the request must be from the participant's private key, verifying they own the address. This prevents unauthorized access to channel information.

Each channel response includes:

- `channel_id`: Unique identifier for the channel
- `participant`: The participant's address
- `wallet`: The wallet address associated with this channel (may differ from participant if using delegation)
- `status`: Current status ("open", "closed", or "joining")
- `token`: The token address for the channel
- `amount`: Total channel capacity
- `chain_id`: The blockchain network ID where the channel exists (e.g., 137 for Polygon, 42220 for Celo, 8453 for Base)
- `adjudicator`: The address of the adjudicator contract
- `challenge`: Challenge period duration in seconds
- `nonce`: Current nonce value for the channel
- `version`: Current version of the channel state
- `created_at`: When the channel was created (ISO 8601 format)
- `updated_at`: When the channel was last updated (ISO 8601 format)

Metadata fields provide pagination information:

- `page`: Current page number
- `per_page`: Number of channels per page
- `total_count`: Total number of channels available
- `page_count`: Total number of pages based on the `per_page` limit

  ],
  "sig": ["0xabcd1234..."]
}
```

### Get Session Keys

Retrieves all active (non-expired) session keys for the authenticated user. Session keys are delegated keys that can perform operations on behalf of the user's wallet with spending caps and expiration times.

This endpoint returns only session keys, not custody signers. Each session key includes its spending allowances and current usage tracking.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "req": [1, "get_session_keys", {}, 1619123456789],
  "sig": ["0x9876fedcba..."]
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "res": [
    1,
    "get_session_keys",
    {
      "session_keys": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "session_key": "0xabcdef1234567890...",
          "application": "Chess Game",
          "allowances": [
            {
              "asset": "usdc",
              "allowance": "100.0",
              "used": "45.0"
            },
            {
              "asset": "eth",
              "allowance": "0.5",
              "used": "0.0"
            }
          ],
          "scope": "app.create",
          "expires_at": "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z",
          "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
        },
        {
          "id": 2,
          "session_key": "0xfedcba0987654321...",
          "application": "Trading Bot",
          "allowances": [
            {
              "asset": "usdc",
              "allowance": "500.0",
              "used": "250.0"
            }
          ],
          "scope": "app.create",
          "expires_at": "2024-06-30T23:59:59Z",
          "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
        }
      ]
    },
    1619123456789
  ],
  "sig": ["0xabcd1234..."]
}
```

Each session key includes:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the session key record
- `session_key`: The address of the session key that can sign transactions
- `application`: Name of the application this session key is authorized for. If set to `"clearnode"`, the session key has root access and bypasses spending allowance and application validation checks.
- `allowances`: Array of asset allowances with usage tracking. Each entry contains:
  - `asset`: Symbol of the asset (e.g., "usdc", "eth")
  - `allowance`: Maximum amount the session key can spend for this asset
  - `used`: Amount already spent by this session key (calculated on the fly from ledger entries)
- `scope`: Permission scope for this session key (e.g., "app.create", "ledger.readonly") (optional field, omitted if empty)
- `expires_at`: When this session key expires (ISO 8601 format)
- `created_at`: When the session key was created (ISO 8601 format)

**Notes:**

- Only active (non-expired) session keys are returned
- If a session key has an empty spending cap array, all operations using that key will be denied (no spending allowed)
- The `used_allowance` is calculated by summing all debit entries in the ledger that were made using this session key
- Available allowance for an asset = `allowance - used_allowance`
- **Special case**: Session keys with `application` set to `"clearnode"` have root access and are exempt from spending allowance limits and application validation. This facilitates backwards compatibility, and will be deprecated after a migration period for developers elapses.

### Revoke Session Key

Revokes a session key by immediately invalidating it. The session key can no longer be used for any operations after revocation.

**Permission Rules:**

- A wallet can revoke any of its session keys
- A session key can revoke itself
- A session key with `application: "clearnode"` can revoke other session keys belonging to the same wallet
- A non-"clearnode" session key cannot revoke other session keys (only itself)

**Request:**

```json
{
  "req": [
    1,
    "revoke_session_key",
    {
      "session_key": "0xabcdef1234567890..."
    },
    1619123456789
  ],
  "sig": ["0x9876fedcba..."] // Signed by main wallet or session key
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "res": [
    1,
    "revoke_session_key",
    {
      "session_key": "0xabcdef1234567890..."
    },
    1619123456789
  ],
  "sig": ["0xabcd1234..."]
}
```

**Parameters:**

- `session_key`: The address of the session key to revoke

**Response Fields:**

- `session_key`: The address of the revoked session key (confirmation)

**Error Cases:**

- Session key does not exist, belongs to another wallet, or is expired: `"operation denied: provided address is not an active session key of this user"`
- Non-"clearnode" session key attempting to revoke another session key: `"operation denied: insufficient permissions for the active session key"`

**Notes:**

- Revocation is immediate and cannot be undone
- After revocation, any operations attempted with the revoked session key will fail with a validation error
- The revoked session key will no longer appear in the `get_session_keys` response
- Revocation is useful for security purposes when a session key may have been compromised

### Transfer Funds

This method allows a user to transfer assets from their unified balance to another account. The user must have sufficient funds for each asset being transferred. The operation will fail if any of the specified assets have insufficient funds.

User may specify the `destination` (wallet address) or `destination_user_tag` (user tag) to identify the recipient. `destination_user_tag` is used if and only if the `destination` field is empty.

CAUTION: Invalid destination address may result in loss of funds.
Currently, `Transfer` supports ledger account of another user as destination (wallet address is identifier).

**Request:**

```json
{
  "req": [1, "transfer", {
    "destination": "0x9876543210abcdef...",
    "allocations": [
      {
        "asset": "usdc",
        "amount": "50.0"

}
```

The response returns an array of transaction objects, with one transaction for each asset being transferred.

Each transaction includes:

- `id`: Unique transaction reference
- `tx_type`: Transaction type (transfer/deposit/withdrawal/app_deposit/app_withdrawal)
- `from_account`: The account that sent the funds
- `from_account_tag`: The user tag for the sender account (empty if no tag exists or not a wallet account)
- `to_account`: The account that received the funds
- `to_account_tag`: The user tag for the recipient account (empty if no tag exists or not a wallet account)
- `asset`: The asset symbol that was transferred
- `amount`: The amount transferred for this specific asset
- `created_at`: When the transaction was created (ISO 8601 format)

## Virtual Application Management

### Create Virtual Application

Creates a virtual application between participants.
Participants must agree on signature weights and a quorum; this quorum is required to submit an intermediate state or close an app session. The create app session request must be signed by all participants with non-zero allocations.

**Important**: The `protocol` field in the definition must be set to "NitroRPC/0.2". This is the only supported protocol version for app sessions.

The optional `session_data` field can be used to store application-specific data that will be preserved throughout the session lifecycle. This enables applications to maintain custom state information such as configuration settings, business logic state, or any other data needed for the application.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "req": [
    1,
    "create_app_session",
    {
      "definition": {
        "application": "clearnode",
        "protocol": "NitroRPC/0.2",
        "participants": [

        ],
        "weights": [50, 50],
        "quorum": 100,

      "allocations": [
        {
          "participant": "0xAaBbCcDdEeFf0011223344556677889900aAbBcC",
          "asset": "usdc",
          "amount": "100.0"
        },
        {
          "participant": "0x00112233445566778899AaBbCcDdEeFf00112233",
          "asset": "usdc",

        }
      ],
      "session_data": "{\"gameType\":\"chess\",\"timeControl\":{\"initial\":600,\"increment\":5},\"maxPlayers\":2,\"gameState\":\"waiting\"}"
    },
    1619123456789
  ],
  "sig": ["0x9876fedcba..."]
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "res": [
    1,
    "create_app_session",
    {
      "app_session_id": "0x3456789012abcdef...",

      "status": "open"
    },
    1619123456789
  ],
  "sig": ["0xabcd1234..."]
}
```

### Submit Application State

Submits an intermediate state into a virtual application and redistributes funds in an app session.
To submit an intermediate state, participants must reach the signature quorum that they agreed on when creating the app session.
This means that the sum of the weights of signers must reach the specified threshold in the app definition.

The optional `session_data` field can be used to update application-specific data associated with the session, allowing applications to track progress, update configurations, or store any custom state changes during the session lifecycle.

#### NitroRPC/0.2

**Request:**

```json
{
  "req": [
    1,
    "submit_app_state",
    {

    1619123456789
  ],
  "sig": ["0xabcd1234..."]
}
```

#### NitroRPC/0.4

NitroRPC/0.4 introduces the following changes:

- The `intent` field is now required and must be set to either `operate`, `deposit` or `withdraw`. It indicates the purpose of the state update.
  - `operate`: For normal application operations that redistribute funds within the session
  - `deposit`: For adding funds to the session from participants' unified balances
  - `withdraw`: For removing funds from the session to participants' unified balances
- The `version` field is now required and must be set to the expected next version number of the app session state. This ensures that state updates are applied in the correct order and prevents replay attacks.

**Allocation Requirements by Intent:**

The `allocations` array format and validation rules depend on the specified `intent`:

- **`operate` intent**: Allocations represent the desired distribution of funds within the session. The total sum of all allocations must equal the current session balance for each asset (zero-sum redistribution). This is used for normal game logic where funds are moved between participants without changing the total session balance.

- **`deposit` intent**: Allocations represent the desired distribution after depositing funds into the session. For participants making deposits, their allocation amount should be higher than their current session balance by the deposit amount. The additional funds will be transferred from their unified balance to the session. Participants with non-zero deposit amounts must be signers of the request in addition to meeting the signature quorum.

- **`withdraw` intent**: Allocations represent the desired distribution after withdrawing funds from the session. For participants making withdrawals, their allocation amount should be lower than their current session balance by the withdrawal amount. The withdrawn funds will be transferred to their unified balance. The signature quorum is required to make a withdrawal.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "req": [
    1,
    "submit_app_state",
    {
      "app_session_id": "0x3456789012abcdef...",

}
```

### Close Virtual Application

Closes a virtual application and redistributes funds.
To close the app session, participants must reach the signature quorum that they agreed on when creating the app session.
This means that the sum of the weights of signers must reach the specified threshold in the app definition.

The optional `session_data` field can be used to provide final application-specific data when closing the session, such as final results, completion status, or any other concluding information that should be preserved with the session closure.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "req": [
    1,
    "close_app_session",
    {
      "app_session_id": "0x3456789012abcdef...",

### Create Channel

Requests opening a channel with a Clearnode broker on a specific network.
Please note that a channel must be created with a zero initial deposit. Later a user may top it up by calling `resize_channel`.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "req": [
    1,
    "create_channel",
    [
      {
        "chain_id": 137,
        "token": "0xeeee567890abcdef..."
      }
    ],
    1619123456789
  ],
  "sig": ["0x9876fedcba..."]
}
```

The request parameters are:

- `chain_id`: The blockchain network ID where the channel should be created
- `token`: The token contract address for the channel

**Response:**

Returns signed initial state with the requested amounts ready to submit on Blockchain.

```json
{
  "res": [
    1,
    "create_channel",
    [
      {
        "channel_id": "0x4567890123abcdef...",
        "channel": {
          "participants": ["0x1234567890abcdef...", "0xbbbb567890abcdef..."],
          "adjudicator": "0xAdjudicatorContractAddress...",
          "challenge": 3600,
          "nonce": 1619123456789
        },
        "state": {
          "intent": 1,
          "version": 0,
          "state_data": "0xc0ffee",
          "allocations": [
            {
              "destination": "0x1234567890abcdef...",
              "token": "0xeeee567890abcdef...",
              "amount": "0"
            },
            {
              "destination": "0xbbbb567890abcdef...",
              "token": "0xeeee567890abcdef...",
              "amount": "0"
            }
          ]
        },

      }
    ],
    1619123456789
  ],
  "sig": ["0xabcd1234..."]
}
```

The response includes:

- `channel_id`: Unique identifier for the channel
- `channel`: Channel definition with participants, adjudicator, challenge period, and nonce
- `state`: Complete initial state structure containing intent, version, state_data, and allocations
- `server_signature`: Broker's signature of the state

### Close Channel

To close a channel, the user must request the final state signed by the broker and then submit it to the smart contract.
Only an open channel can be closed. In case the user does not agree with the final state provided by the broker, they can call the `challenge` method directly on the smart contract.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "req": [
    1,
    "close_channel",
    {
      "channel_id": "0x4567890123abcdef...",
      "funds_destination": "0x1234567890abcdef..."
    },
    1619123456789
  ],
  "sig": ["0x9876fedcba..."]
}
```

In the request, the user must specify funds destination. After the channel is closed, funds become available to withdraw from the smart contract for the specified address.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "res": [
    1,
    "close_channel",
    {
      "channel_id": "0x4567890123abcdef...",
      "state": {
        "intent": 3, // IntentFINALIZE - constant specifying that this is a final state
        "version": 123,
        "state_data": "0xc0ffee",
        "allocations": [
          {
            "destination": "0x1234567890abcdef...", // Provided funds address
            "token": "0xeeee567890abcdef...",
            "amount": "50000"
          },
          {
            "destination": "0xbbbb567890abcdef...", // Broker address
            "token": "0xeeee567890abcdef...",
            "amount": "50000"
          }
        ]
      },
      "server_signature": "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1c"
    },
    1619123456789
  ],
  "sig": ["0xabcd1234..."]
}
```

### Resize Channel

Adjusts the capacity of a channel by depositing or withdrawing funds.

**IMPORTANT**: Once a resize is requested, the channel moves to a "resizing" status. The resize on-chain channel state must be submitted to the blockchain to complete the resize operation. If the resize transaction is not submitted and lost, the channel will remain in the resizing status indefinitely, and the only way to recover the funds would be to close the channel. Later to resume operations, the user will be able to reopen a channel.

**Fund Locking**: When withdrawing funds (negative `resize_amount`), the funds being withdrawn are immediately locked until the resize transaction on-chain confirmation is seen and processed by the Node.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "req": [
    1,
    "resize_channel",
    {
      "channel_id": "0x4567890123abcdef...",
      "resize_amount": "-1000000000",
      "allocate_amount": "+1000000000",
      "funds_destination": "0x1234567890abcdef..."
    },
    1619123456789
  ],
  "sig": ["0x9876fedcba..."]
}
```

**Request Parameters:**

- `channel_id`: The ID of the channel to resize.
- `resize_amount`: Amount to deposit (positive) or withdraw (negative) from the channel.
- `allocate_amount`: Amount to allocate to (positive) or deallocate from (negative) this specific channel from the user's unified balance.
- `funds_destination`: User's allocation funds destination for the resize state.

**Example Scenarios:**

- Initial state: user an open channel on Polygon with 20 usdc, and a channel on Celo with 5 usdc.
- User wants to deposit 75 usdc on Celo. User calls `resize_channel`, with `allocate_amount=0` and `resize_amount=75`.
- Now user's unified balance is 100 usdc (20 on Polygon and 80 on Celo).
- Now user wants wo withdraw all 100 usdc on Polygon. To withdraw, user must allocate 80 on this specific channel (`allocate_amount=80`), and resize it (`resize_amount=-100`). Also it is recommended to deallocate the channel on Celo (optional, but we may make this required in the future).
- Note: all amounts are shown as examples. In your requests, you must specify these amounts in raw format.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "res": [
    1,
    "resize_channel",
    {
      "channel_id": "0x4567890123abcdef...",
      "state": {
        "intent": 2, // IntentRESIZE
        "version": 5,
        "state_data": "0xc0ffee",
        "allocations": [
          {
            "destination": "0x1234567890abcdef...",
            "token": "0xeeee567890abcdef...",
            "amount": "100000"
          },
          {
            "destination": "0xbbbb567890abcdef...", // Broker address
            "token": "0xeeee567890abcdef...",
            "amount": "0"
          }
        ]
      },
      "server_signature": "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1c"
    },
    1619123456789
  ],
  "sig": ["0xabcd1234..."]
}
```

**Response Fields:**

- `channel_id`: The ID of the channel being resized
- `state`: The complete resize state that must be submitted to the blockchain
  - `intent`: Always 2 (IntentRESIZE) for resize operations
  - `version`: The new version number for this channel state
  - `state_data`: Encoded state data for the resize operation
  - `allocations`: The final allocation distribution after resize
- `server_signature`: Clearnode's signature of the resize state (required for blockchain submission)

**Important Notes:**

1. **Channel Status**: After calling `resize_channel`, the channel enters `resizing` status and cannot be used for other operations until the resize state is submitted on-chain
2. **Blockchain Submission Required**: You must submit the returned state to the blockchain using the Custody contract's `resize(...)` method. The channel remains in "resizing" status until this transaction is confirmed
3. **Recovery**: If you don't submit the resize transaction, you cannot perform any other operations on this channel except closing it
4. **Fund Locking**: For withdrawals (negative `resize_amount`), the withdrawn funds are locked in your unified balance and cannot be spent until the blockchain transaction is confirmed or the channel is closed.

    },
    1619123456789
  ],
  "sid": "0x3456789012abcdef...", // Virtual App Session ID
  "sig": ["0x9876fedcba..."]
}
```

## Utility Methods

### Ping

Simple ping to check connectivity.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "req": [1, "ping", {}, 1619123456789],
  "sig": ["0x9876fedcba..."]
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "res": [1, "pong", {}, 1619123456789],
  "sig": ["0xabcd1234..."]
}
```

### Balance Updates

The server automatically sends balance updates to clients in these scenarios:

1. After successful authentication (as a welcome message)
2. After channel operations (open, close, resize)
3. After application operations (create, close)

Balance updates are sent as unsolicited server messages with the "bu" method:

```json
{
  "res": [
    1234567890123,
    "bu",
    {
      "balance_updates": [
        {
          "asset": "usdc",
          "amount": "100.0"
        },
        {
          "asset": "eth",
          "amount": "0.5"
        }
      ]
    },
    1619123456789
  ],
  "sig": ["0xabcd1234..."]
}
```

The balance update provides the latest balances for all assets in the participant's unified ledger, allowing clients to maintain an up-to-date view of available funds without explicitly requesting them.

### Open Channels

The server automatically sends all open channels as a batch update to clients after successful authentication.

```json
{
  "res": [
    1234567890123,
    "channels",
    {
      "channels": [
        {
          "channel_id": "0xfedcba9876543210...",
          "participant": "0x1234567890abcdef...",
          "status": "open",
          "token": "0xeeee567890abcdef...",
          "amount": "100000",
          "chain_id": 137,
          "adjudicator": "0xAdjudicatorContractAddress...",
          "challenge": 86400,
          "nonce": 1,
          "version": 2,
          "created_at": "2023-05-01T12:00:00Z",
          "updated_at": "2023-05-01T12:30:00Z"
        },
        {
          "channel_id": "0xabcdef1234567890...",
          "participant": "0x1234567890abcdef...",
          "status": "open",
          "token": "0xeeee567890abcdef...",
          "amount": "50000",
          "chain_id": 42220,
          "adjudicator": "0xAdjudicatorContractAddress...",
          "challenge": 86400,
          "nonce": 1,
          "version": 3,
          "created_at": "2023-04-15T10:00:00Z",
          "updated_at": "2023-04-20T14:30:00Z"
        }
      ]
    },
    1619123456789
  ],
  "sig": ["0xabcd1234..."]
}
```

### Channel Updates

For channel updates, the server sends them in these scenarios:

1. When a channel is created
2. When a channel's status changes (open, joined, closed)
3. When a channel is resized

Individual channel updates are sent as unsolicited server messages with the "cu" method:

```json
{
  "res": [
    1234567890123,
    "cu",
    {
      "channel_id": "0xfedcba9876543210...",
      "participant": "0x1234567890abcdef...",
      "status": "open",
      "token": "0xeeee567890abcdef...",
      "amount": "100000",
      "chain_id": 137,
      "adjudicator": "0xAdjudicatorContractAddress...",
      "challenge": 86400,
      "nonce": 1,
      "version": 2,
      "created_at": "2023-05-01T12:00:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2023-05-01T12:30:00Z"
    },
    1619123456789
  ],
  "sig": ["0xabcd1234..."]
}
```

The channel update contains the complete current state of a specific channel, allowing clients to maintain an up-to-date view of their channels without explicitly requesting them through the `get_channels` method.

### Transfer Notifications

The server automatically sends transfer notifications to clients when funds are transferred to their account. These notifications inform the recipient about incoming transfers.

Transfer notifications are sent as unsolicited server messages with the "transfer" method:

```json
{
  "res": [
    1234567890123,
    "tr",
    {
      "transactions": [
        {
          "id": "1",
          "tx_type": "transfer",
          "from_account": "0x9876543210abcdef...",
          "from_account_tag": "ABC123",
          "to_account": "0x1234567890abcdef...",
          "to_account_tag": "XYZ789",
          "asset": "usdc",
          "amount": "50.0",
          "created_at": "2023-05-01T12:00:00Z"
        },
        {
          "id": "2",
          "tx_type": "transfer",
          "from_account": "0x9876543210abcdef...",
          "from_account_tag": "ABC123",
          "to_account": "0x1234567890abcdef...",
          "to_account_tag": "XYZ789",
          "asset": "weth",
          "amount": "0.1",
          "created_at": "2023-05-01T12:00:00Z"
        }
      ]
    },
    1619123456789
  ],
  "sig": ["0xabcd1234..."]
}
```

The transfer notification contains an array of transaction objects representing the incoming transfers. Each transaction includes:

- `id`: Unique transaction reference
- `tx_type`: Transaction type (currently only "transfer" for these notifications)
- `from_account`: The account that sent the funds
- `from_account_tag`: The user tag for the sender account (empty if no tag exists)
- `to_account`: The account that received the funds (the notification recipient)
- `to_account_tag`: The user tag for the recipient account (empty if no tag exists)
- `asset`: The asset symbol that was transferred
- `amount`: The amount transferred for this specific asset
- `created_at`: When the transaction was created (ISO 8601 format)
